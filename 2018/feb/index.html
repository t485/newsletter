        </ul>

        <h2>Fun facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When Yosemite was first explored, Half Dome was said to be “unclimbable.” Now there are cables running to the
                top, and thousands of people climb it each year.</li>
            <li>In June 2017, Alex Honnold became the first to free-solo El Capitan, climbing Freerider (5.12d) in about 4 hours.
                Free-soloing is essentially climbing without ropes to break one’s fall. </li>
            <li>Colorado has more than 4 times the number of peaks over 14,000 feet (affectionately called “Fourteeners”) than
                California does, but California still has the tallest peak in the Lower 48, Mt. Whitney, which stands at
                14,505 feet. </li>
            <li>The mountains in the Sierra Nevada gradually increase in elevation the further south you head. In the Lake Tahoe
                area, the tallest mountains don’t go above 10,000 feet. In Yosemite, the tallest mountains are just above
                13,000 feet. This steady rise in elevation culminates at Mt. Whitney, after which elevations drop rapidly.</li>
            <li>The 1964 Wilderness Act, signed by Lyndon B. Johnson, designated wilderness areas to be “an area where the earth
                and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” Along
                with the National Park System, this act is responsible for the preservation of so much of America’s natural
                beauty.
            </li>
            <li>The Sierra Nevada happens to be the site of numerous small-plane crashes, mostly due to its erratic wind systems.
                Many of the crash sites are undocumented and date back to numerous decades ago. Since these crash sites are
                at such high elevations, there is no good way of extracting the wreckage, so many crash sites are still preserved
                to this date.</li>
            <li>The Yosemite Valley is an international hub for rock climbing, due to its impressive terrain. In fact, the rock
                climbing sport and culture was born in the valley during the 60’s, stemming from the small community of climbers
                that would illegally camp for months at a time in Camp 4. This is, perhaps, the root of the tensions that
                have existed between rock climbers and park rangers over the past decades, something the park has tried to
                alleviate over the past couple of years.</li>

        <h2>Introducing the Troop 485 Monthly Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            Some of you may wonder about what’s goes on behind the scenes in our troop. Some of you might just want a short summary of
            the recent things are happening. Maybe you’re just interested in learning something? This newsletter is meant
            to serve
            <i>you</i>, a member of our community, and inform you about some of the developments of our ever-improving troop.
            Our troop is all the more excellent when everybody is on the same page—this newsletter will bring us one step
            closer to that.
        </p>

        <h2>What happened to Bearpaw? </h2>
        <span class="author">
            <i>Richard Liu</i>
        </span>
        <p>
            The low levels of snow this year has forced our troop to cancel many iconic winter activities, such as BearPaw. BearPaw is
            an activity organised by the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council located in Cisco Grove, CA each year. Participants
            of BearPaw build a snow shelter and spend the night in it. However, due to the low amounts of snow, our troop
            will not be going to BearPaw this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was put to a vote at a recent Patrol Leaders Council, and the backup option won by 9 votes to 7. Although BearPaw has
            been cancelled, we will still go to a campout on that day. SiCs Glen Chen and Samuel Wong have planned a backup
            campout to Point Reyes National Seashore, a coastal geological abnormality just north of the Golden Gate. Campsites
            in the park have filled up, so instead we will be camping at Samuel Taylor State Park.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may be interested in how much snow have we been getting this year, and whether it is really bad enough to cancel BearPaw,
            <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/products/PLOT_SWC.pdf">Here</a> is a chart showing precipitation for northern, central, and southern California, compared to several
            other years.

        <h2>New adventures: April Backpacking</h2>
        <span class="author">
            <i>Jacob Nie</i>
        </span>
        <p>
            To my knowledge, the troop has never gone on a backpacking trip for longer than 3 days, with the exception of high adventure
            trips. While this may seem daunting, it should give you cause for excitement (and joy, if you’re that kind of
            person). Weather and snow permitting, our troop will send 1-2 crews to the Yosemite wilderness, both headed on
            25-35 mile treks on trails with some of the best mountain peaks and alpine lakes that California has to offer.
            The hiking will be tiresome and the days will be hard, but the difficulties we face will only serve to test the
            strength of our character, the durability of our comradeship, and the intensity of our passion. I’m sorry not
            everybody could sign up due to the unwieldy date, but to everybody who could, it’s going to be good.
        </p>

            <i>“Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.
                The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop away
                from you like the leaves of Autumn.”</i> -John Muir, The Mountains of California

        <h2>Website Updates</h2>
        <span class="author">
            <i>Jeffrey Meng</i>
        </span>
        <p>
            Over the past couple of months, I have been reaching out to some people in our troop to brainstorm new features for the website
            to make it more functional and integral for our troop needs. Some new features include a revamped authentication
            system, more security, better event pages, and a headcount collector! Here are some of the features that we have
            planned:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="underline">Revamped authentication system:</span> Some information on our website is private, and these pages cannot
                be accessed by just anybody. The current authentication system is not secure enough, and I am working to
                create an authentication system that is both secure and fluid enough to be practical.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="underline">Better event pages:</span> Event pages have become an important tool our troop uses to catalog information
                in an organized fashion. As SiC’s begin to use it more and more, some deficiencies have been uncovered, and
                I will work to implement new changes to make event pages even better.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="underline">Website-integrated headcount form:</span> Recording headcounts for upcoming events has always been a struggle
                in the past, and this was an update that was very well-received by our small committee. I am creating a tool
                that will help both event planners and attendees record their attendance in a manner that is both fluid and
                organized. It will also be integrated into the event pages</li>
            <li>
                <span class="underline">Self-updates:</span> This is an extremely useful tool that will allow people with certain troop jobs to self-update
                the website. For example, this will enable the scribe to upload troop meeting minutes directly onto the website
                without having to go through the webmaster. Similarly, the historian will now be able to upload pictures
                and links directly onto the troop website. This all goes towards making our website more dynamic and helpful
                to any member of our troop.</li>
        </ul>
